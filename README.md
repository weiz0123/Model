# Model Overview

This project provides a foundation for exploring, testing, and optimizing quantitative trading strategies using historical financial data. The current implementation is based on the QQU ETF dataset, with a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy as the starting point.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Build a clean and modular pipeline for backtesting trading strategies.
- Evaluate performance using detailed metrics and visualizations.
- Extend to advanced techniques including portfolio optimization and deep learning.

---

## ðŸ”§ Current Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Load and clean historical price data from CSV files.
- **Signal Generation:** Basic strategies like SMA/EMA crossovers.
- **Backtesting:** Use `vectorbt.Portfolio.from_signals` for efficient simulation.
- **Visualization:** Plot price, indicators, equity curve, and entry/exit points.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Generate comprehensive stats and charts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Strategy Roadmap

Planned strategies and extensions:

### âœ… Traditional Quant Strategies
- Trend-following: SMA, EMA, MACD, breakout systems
- Mean-reversion: RSI, Bollinger Bands, z-score spreads
- Volatility-based filters
- Risk management: Stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing

### ðŸ§ª Testing Methods
- Parameter optimization (grid search, walk-forward)
- Cross-validation over multiple time periods
- Strategy robustness under regime changes

---

## ðŸ“Š Portfolio-Level Features (Planned)
- Multi-asset strategy testing
- Sector or theme rotation strategies
- Correlation-aware portfolio allocation
- Dynamic rebalancing and capital distribution

---

## ðŸ¤– Future Deep Learning Enhancements

Use ML/DL models to improve signal quality and forecasting:

- **Time Series Forecasting:** LSTM, GRU, Transformer models
- **Pattern Recognition:** Autoencoders, CNNs for technical pattern classification
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents that learn trading rules (DQN, PPO)
- **Multi-modal Models:** Combine price with news, earnings, and alternative data

---

## ðŸ“Œ Final Goal

Build a flexible experimentation framework that combines traditional quant techniques with modern AI/ML methods to evaluate trading performance across strategies, timeframes, and asset classes.
